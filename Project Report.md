## Introduction

In this project, I analyzed the relationship between energy usage and gross domestic product with data of 181 countries from 2004 to 2017. With both OLS regression and panel regressions, I found positive relationship between energy consumption and GDP. 



The causality relationship between energy consumption and income is a well-studied topic in energy economics. Intuitively speaking, more energy consumption usually indicates more production and economic behavior. However, to testify this relationship, we need to understand the difference between comparison across countries and comparison within countries across time. If we use Iceland as an example, due to the harsh environment, Icelanders tend to consume more energy on s
